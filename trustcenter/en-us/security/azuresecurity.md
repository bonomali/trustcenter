               <p>As enterprises adopt public and hybrid cloud solutions, they do extensive due diligence on their providers’ security policies, operations, and systems. Confidential data is the lifeblood of any company, and many industry companies are also bound by extensive regulations regarding the use, transmission, and storage of Customer Data. 
               </p>
               <p>Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet provides businesses with the data security and privacy, control, and transparency they require. Security and privacy are embedded in the Azure platform, using the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), from initial planning through solution launch, as well as the upgrades we continue to make. Security Management Process provides security guidelines for our operational processes, and <a target="_self" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.azure.cn/support/legal/privacy-statement/">Microsoft Azure Operated by 21Vianet Privacy Statement</a> governs how we build and operate the services.  </p>

               <p>Azure uses multiple safeguards to protect customer and enterprise data. These security practices and technologies include: </p>
                  <p><strong>Identity and access management </strong></p>
                  <p>Identity and access management</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                     <li>Helps ensure that only authorized users can access your environments, data, and applications.</li>
                     <li>Offers multi-factor authentication for highly secure sign-in, including specialized administrative access through Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management.</li>
                     <li>Performs authentication, authorization, and access control through industry-standard protocols to help developers integrate identity management into their apps across different platforms, and to build mobile and web apps that integrate with Microsoft and third-party APIs with OAuth 2.0.</li>
                     <li>Works as a standalone cloud directory for your organization or can be integrated with your on-premises Active Directory with directory sync and single sign-on (SSO).Allows federated applications to support user provisioning and password vaulting.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><b>Azure Multi-Factor Authentication</b></p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                     <li>Requires users to verify their sign-ins via mobile app, phone call, or text message.</li>
                     <li>Azure Active Directory Premium edition adds Multi-Factor Authentication custom greetings, fraud alert, security reports, one-time bypass, blocking/unblocking of users, customizable caller ID for authentication phone calls, and more.</li>

                  <p><span><strong>Encryption</strong> – Azure uses industry-standard protocols to encrypt Customer Data as it travels between devices and Azure datacenters,crosses between datacenters.</span></p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                     <li>Protection for data in transit and at rest, including encryption for data, files, applications, services, communications, and drives</li>

                     <li>Configuration support on VHDs that contain sensitive information.</li>
                     <li>Access to data by Azure support personnel requires your explicit permission and is granted on a “just in time” basis that is logged and audited, then revoked after completion of the engagement. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><b>Azure Key Vault service</b></p>
                  <p>Secure key management is essential to protecting data in the cloud. Azure Key Vault enables Azure subscribers to safeguard and control cryptographic keys and other secrets used by cloud apps and services.</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                     <li>Encrypt keys and small secrets like passwords using keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).</li>
                     <li>Import or generate your keys in HSMs certified to FIPS 140-2 level 2 standards for added assurance, so that your keys stay within the HSM boundary.</li>
                     <li>Simplify and automate tasks for SSL/TLS certificates, enroll and automatically renew certificates from supported Public Certification Authority's (CA).</li>
                     <li>Provision and deploy new Vaults and Keys in minutes without waiting for procurement, hardware or IT and centrally manage keys, secrets, and policies.</li>
                     <li>Maintain control over encrypted data—grant and revoke key use by your own and third-party applications as needed.</li>
                     <li>Segregate key management duties to enable developers to easily manage keys used for dev/test and migrate seamlessly to production keys managed by security operations.</li>
                     <li>Rapidly scale to meet the cryptographic needs of your cloud applications and match peak demand.</li>

                  <p><span><strong>Secure networks </strong>  – Azure infrastructure relies on security practices and technologies to connect virtual machines to each other and to on-premises datacenters, while blocking unauthorized traffic. Azure Virtual Networks extend your on-premises network to the cloud via a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN). You can also use <a target="_self" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.azure.cn/home/features/expressroute/">ExpressRoute</a> to create a cross-premises connection when needing a private network connection. </span></p>

                  <p><b>Physical infrastructure security-</b>Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet is physically and logically entirely isolated from Microsoft Cloud services in other regions of the world, which is protected by layers of defense-in-depth security that include perimeter fencing, video cameras, security personnel, secure entrances, and real-time communications networks. The defense-in-depth security is in use throughout every area of the facility, including each physical server unit.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Azure prevents unauthorized and unintentional transfer of information between deployments in a multitenant architecture, using virtual local area network (VLAN) isolation, access control lists (ACLs), load balancers, and IP filters, along with traffic flow policies; network address translation (NAT) separates internal network traffic from external traffic.</p>
