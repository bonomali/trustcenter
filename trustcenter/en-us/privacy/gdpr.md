                <h4>What is GDPR? </h4>
                <p>On May 25, 2018, a European privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), took effect. The GDPR imposes new rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze personal data tied to EU residents. </p>
                <p>This site is designed to provide you information about the capabilities in Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet that you can use to address specific requirements of the GDPR. Access the documentation helpful to your GDPR accountability, and to your understanding of the technical and organizational measures that have been taken to support the GDPR. Documentation for Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), Data Subject Requests (DSRs), and Data Breach Notification is provided to incorporate into your own accountability program in support of the GDPR.</p>
                <h4>Data Subject Requests (DSR) for GDPR </h4>
                <p>GDPR grants individuals (or, data subjects) certain rights in connection with the processing of their personal data, including the right to correct inaccurate data, erase data or restrict its processing, receive their data and fulfill a request to transmit their data to another controller. Below we discuss what the GDPR requires of controllers (you) and processors (21Vianet) to respond to those requests, and how we will enable you to do so.</p>
                <p>The Tenant Administrator role can request data on behalf of a data subject in several ways:</p>
                <p><strong>DSR - Forget User Data</strong></p>
                <p>Using the Azure Active Directory Admin Center, a Tenant Administrator can permanently delete a data subject from Azure Active Directory and related services – <a href="https://portal.azure.con/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UserManagementMenuBlade/All users/menuId/">AZURE AD ADMIN CENTER</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>DSR - Export System Generated Logs</strong></p>
                <p>System generated logs for Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet can be exported by Tenant Administrators using the Data Log Export - <a href="https://aka.ms/MicrosoftGDPRChina">Microsoft Azure Portal operated by 21Vianet</a>.</p>
                <p>NOTE: Office 365 customers must first create an Azure subscription before they can create DSR export for system generated logs. Please follow these step-by-step specific instructions for creating a new Azure subscription. </p>
                <p>If you have any questions, please contact <a href="https://support.office.com/article/contact-support-for-business-products-admin-help-32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b">Support</a>. </p>
                <p><strong>DSR - Export User Generated Data</strong></p>
                <p>User generated data can be exported using SharePoint Online and Mailbox search as well as via in-application features.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Mailbox Search – a Tenant Administrator can use the New-MailboxSearch cmdlet or go to the Exchange Admin center as a part of the In-place eDiscovery search – <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd353189(v=exchg.160).aspx">Mailbox Search Guide</a></li>
                <li>Mailbox and SharePoint Online Search – a Tenant Administrator can use the eDiscovery center in SharePoint Online to be able to perform content searches – <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-an-eDiscovery-Center-in-SharePoint-Online-A18F8975-AA7F-43B4-A7D6-001D14744D8E">Mailbox and SharePoint Search Guide</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Guidance for in-product/service data export for Data Subject Requests is found in the <a href="https://aka.ms/DSRCompliance">Data Subject Request (DSR) How-To FAQ</a>. </p>
                <h4>Data Breach Notification under GDPR</h4>
                <p>The GDPR mandates notification requirements for data controllers and processors in the event of a breach of personal data. The information below discusses those provisions, how we as Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet try to prevent breaches in the first place, how we detect a breach, and how we will respond in the event of breach and notify you as a data controller.</p>
                <p>Breach Notification FAQ</p>
                <p><strong>What constitutes a breach of personal data under GDPR?</strong></p>
                <p>Personal data means any information related to an individual that can be used to identify that individual directly or indirectly. A personal data breach is “a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.”</p>
                <p><strong>Your responsibilities as the controller</strong></p>
                <p>In the event of a breach of personal data that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals (such as discrimination, identity theft, fraud, financial loss, or damage to their reputation), the GDPR requires you to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Notify the appropriate Data Protection Authority (DPA) without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of it — for example, after Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet notifies you. If you don’t notify the DPA within that time, you’ll need to explain why to the DPA. This notice to the DPA is required. </li>
                <li>Notify the data subjects of the breach without undue delay.</li>
                <li>Document the breach including a description of the nature of the breach — such as how many people were impacted, the number of data records affected, the consequences of the breach, and any remedial action your organization is proposing or took.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Responsibilities of 21Vianet as the data processor</strong></p>
                <p>Once 21Vianet becomes aware of a personal data breach, the GDPR requires that 21Vianet notify you without undue delay. For Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet, 21Vianet is the data processor, and these obligations reflect both GDPR requirements and our standard, worldwide contractual provisions. We consider that all confirmed personal data breaches are in scope. We will notify our customers whether the data breach was suffered by Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet directly or by any of our sub-processors. We have processes in place to quickly identify and contact security incident personnel you’ve identified in your organization. In addition, all sub-processors are contractually obliged to report their own breaches to 21Vianet, and provide guarantees to that effect.</p>
                <p><strong>How will Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet detect a data breach?</strong></p>
                <p>All our services and personnel follow internal incident management procedures to ensure that we take proper precautions to avoid data breaches in the first place. However, in addition, Microsoft business cloud services have specific security controls in place across our platforms to detect data breaches in the rare event that they occur.</p>
                <p><strong>How will Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet respond to data breach?</strong></p>
                <p>To support you in the event of a breach of personal data 21Vianet has: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Security personnel trained on the specific procedures to follow.</li>
                <li>Policies, procedures, and controls in place to ensure that Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet maintains detailed records. This includes documentation that captures the facts of the incident, its effects, and remedial action, as well as tracking and storing information in our incident management systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How will 21Vianet notify me in the event of a data breach?</strong></p>
                <p>Individually, Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet each provide specific documentation on their handling of a data breach. </p>
                <h4>Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)</h4>
                <p><strong>Your Responsibilities as a Controller</strong></p>
                <p>Under the GDPR, as a controller you are required to undertake DPIAs prior to data processing that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals—in particular, processing using new technologies. The GDPR provides the following non-exhaustive list of cases in which DPIAs must be carried out: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Automated processing for the purposes of profiling and similar activities that has legal effects or similarly significantly affects data subjects</li>
                <li>Processing on a large scale of special categories of personal data – data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, and the like—or of data relating to criminal convictions and offences; </li>
                <li>Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>GDPR also requires that you must consult with your Data Protection Authority (DPA) before you begin any processing if you cannot identify sufficient mitigations to minimize high risks to data subjects. </p>
                <p><strong>Responsibilities for 21Vianet</strong></p>
                <p>21Vianet practices privacy by design and privacy by default in its engineering and business functions. As part of these efforts, we perform comprehensive privacy reviews on data processing operations that have the potential to cause impacts to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Privacy teams embedded in the service groups review the design and implementation of services to ensure that personal data is processed in a respectful manner that accords with international law, user expectations, and our express commitments. </p>
                <p><strong>How 21Vianet Can Help You Prepare DPIAs </strong></p>
                <p>21Vianet, as a data processor, has a duty to assist controllers in ensuring compliance with the DPIA requirements laid out in the GDPR. </p>
                <p>To support our customers, we publish information on this site (trustcenter.cn). </p>
                <h4>GDPR Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h4>
                <p><strong>What does the GDPR require and what are my responsibilities as the controller?</strong></p>
                <p>As controller, the GDPR requires you to be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Give data subjects a copy of their personal data, together with an explanation of the categories of their data that are being processed, the purposes of that processing, and the categories of third parties to whom their data may be disclosed.</li>
                <li>Help every individual exercise their right to correct inaccurate personal data, erase data or restrict its processing, receive their data in a readable form, and, where applicable, fulfill a request to transmit their data to another controller.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What does GDPR require and what are the responsibilities for 21Vianet as a processor? </strong></p>
                <p>We must implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to assist you in responding to requests from data subjects exercising their rights as discussed above.</p>
                <p><strong>How do Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet enable you to respond to data subject requests?</strong></p>
                <p>Microsoft business cloud services operated by 21Vianet offer a host of capabilities to enable you, as a controller, to respond to a data subject’s request. Microsoft enterprise cloud services and administrative controls operated by 21Vianet help you act on personal data responsive to data subject rights requests, allowing you to discover, access, rectify, restrict, delete, and export personal data that resides in the controller-managed data stored in Microsoft services operated by 21Vianet. </p>
