               <p style="font-size:28px;font-weight:500;">Helping to protect Customer Data at rest and Customer Data in transit</p>
               <!-- <label>Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet</label> -->
               <p>Customer Data is an organization’s most valuable and irreplaceable asset, and encryption serves as the last and strongest line of defense in a multilayered Customer Data security strategy. 21Vianet cloud services use encryption to safeguard Customer Data and help you maintain control over it. Encrypting your information renders it unreadable to unauthorized persons, even if they break through your firewalls, infiltrate your network, get physical access to your devices, or bypass the permissions on your local machine. Encryption transforms Customer Data so that only someone with the decryption key can access it.</p>
               <p>Our products also use industry-standard secure transport protocols for Customer Data as it moves through a network—whether between user devices and datacenters or within datacenters themselves. To help protect Customer Data at rest, 21Vianet offers a range of built-in encryption capabilities.</p>
               <p style="font-size:26px;font-weight:500;">Secure identity</p>
               <p>Identity (of a user, computer, or both) is a key element in many encryption technologies. For example, in public key (asymmetric) cryptography, a key pair—consisting of a public and a private key—is issued to each user. Because only the owner of the key pair has access to the private key, the use of that key identifies the associated owner as a party to the encryption/decryption process. Microsoft Public Key Infrastructure is based on certificates that verify the identity of users and computers.</p>
               <p style="font-size:26px;font-weight:500;">Secure infrastructure</p>
               <p>21Vianet uses multiple encryption methods, protocols, and algorithms across its services to help provide a secure path for Customer Data to travel through the infrastructure, and to help protect the confidentiality of Customer Data that is stored within the infrastructure. 21Vianet uses some of the strongest, most secure encryption protocols in the industry to provide a barrier against unauthorized access to your Customer Data. Proper key management is an essential element in encryption best practices, and 21Vianet helps ensure that encryption keys are properly secured by Microsoft’s technology.</p>
               <p style="font-size:20px">Protocols and technologies examples include:</p>
               <p>Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL), which uses symmetric cryptography based on a shared secret to encrypt communications as they travel over the network.</p>
               <p><strong>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)</strong>, an industry-standard set of protocols used to provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of Customer Data at the IP packet level as it’s transferred across the network.</p>
               <p><strong>Azure Storage Service Encryption</strong> encrypts Customer Data at rest when it’s stored in Azure Blob storage. Azure Disk Encryption encrypts your Windows and Linux infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machine disks by using the BitLocker feature of Windows and the DM-Crypt feature of Linux to provide volume encryption for the operating system and the data disk.</p>
               <p><a href="https://www.azure.cn/documentation/articles/sql-data-warehouse-encryption-tde/">Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) </a>encrypts Customer Data at rest when it’s stored in an Azure SQL database.</p>
               <p style="font-size:26px;font-weight:500;">Secure apps and data</p>
               <p>Microsoft Azure, Office 365 and Power BI operated by 21Vianet use encryption to safeguard Customer Data and help you maintain control over it. When Customer Data moves over a network—between user devices and Azure, Office 365 and Power BI datacenters or within the datacenters themselves—Azure, Office 365 and Power BI use industry-standard secure transport protocols. For Customer Data at rest, Azure, Office 365 and Power BI offer a range of encryption capabilities, giving you the flexibility to choose the solution that best meets your needs.</p>
               <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:500;">Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet</p>
               <p>Technological safeguards, such as encrypted communications and operational processes, help keep your Customer Data secure. You also have the flexibility to implement additional encryption and manage your own keys. </p>
               <ul>
                  <li><span><strong>Data in transit.</strong>Azure uses industry-standard secure transport protocols such as IPsec and SSL/TLS between user devices and Azure datacenters, and within datacenters themselves. You can enable encryption for traffic between your own virtual machines (VMs) and your users. With Azure Virtual Networks, you can use the industry-standard IPsec protocol to encrypt traffic between your corporate VPN gateway and Azure and even between the VMs located on your Azure Virtual Network. <br><a target="_self" class="mscom-link withArrow" href="https://www.azure.cn/home/features/networking/">Learn more about virtual networks in Azure</a></span></li>
                  <li><span><strong>Data at rest. </strong>Azure offers a number of encryption options, giving you the flexibility to choose the solution that best meets your needs in a number of data storage scenarios. <br><a target="_self" class="mscom-link withArrow" href="https://www.azure.cn/documentation/articles/storage-service-encryption/">Learn more about Azure Storage Encryption</a></span></li>
                  <li><span><strong>Azure Key Vault </strong>helps you easily and cost-effectively simplify key management and maintain control of keys used by cloud apps and services to encrypt Customer Data.<br><a target="_self" class="mscom-link withArrow" href="https://www.azure.cn/home/features/key-vault/">Learn more about Azure Key Vault</a></span></li>
                  <li><span><strong>Encrypted communications.</strong>Built-in SSL and TLS cryptography enables customers to encrypt communications within and between deployments, from Azure to on-premises datacenters, and from Azure to administrators and users.</span></li>

               <p style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 500;">Office 365 operated by 21Vianet </p>
               <p>Office 365 services follow industry cryptographic standards such as SSL/TLS and AES to protect the confidentiality and integrity of Customer Data.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Data in transit.</strong>All customer-facing servers negotiate a secure session using SSL/TLS with client machines to secure Customer Data in transit. This applies to protocols used by clients such as Skype for Business Online, Outlook, and Outlook on the web on any device. </li>
                  <li><strong>Data at rest. </strong>OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online encrypt Customer Data at rest using file-level encryption. Office 365 moves beyond a single encryption key per disk to deliver a unique encryption key per file. Every file stored in SharePoint Online—including OneDrive for Business folders—is encrypted with its own key. Your organization’s files will be distributed across multiple Azure Storage containers, each with separate credentials, rather than all of them being stored in a single database. 
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>In some scenarios, we use file-level encryption.</strong>For example, the files and presentations uploaded by meeting participants are encrypted by using AES encryption. OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online also use file-level encryption to encrypt Customer Data at rest. Office 365 moves beyond a single encryption key per disk to deliver a unique encryption key so that every file stored in SharePoint Online—including OneDrive for Business folders—is encrypted with its own key. Your organization’s files are distributed across multiple Azure Storage containers, each with separate credentials, rather than storing them in a single database. Spreading encrypted files across storage locations, encrypting the map of file locations itself, and physically separating master encryption keys from both content and the file map make OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online a highly secure environment for stored files.</li>

               <p>For Customer Data in transit, all Customer Data requested and transmitted by Power BI is encrypted in transit by using HTTPS to connect from the Customer Data source to the Power BI service. A secure connection is established with the Customer Data provider before Customer Data can traverse the network. <!-- <br><a href="###">Learn more about Power BI Security Whitepaper</a> -->
